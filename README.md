Made by カラス, or カラス#2227 on discord. If any issues are found with the tool, message me here about it ;)

This tool converts traditional P4U2 combo notation and to the text formatting found in the game's trial.ang file. This converter also includes a plethora of modifiers to add to your combo's converted trial data. For the best usage of this tool, pair it with Kiwi515's P4U2 Trial Editor and my P4U2 Training Mode Recording Input Parser to easily create your own custom trial!
